/* Question 1.
 * 
 * The controller has a reference to a UserList because it needs to modify the model
 * (the Model interface only provides a read-only access, so that it can be used by the view)
 * 
 * The controller has a reference to the View interface to be as generic as possible.
 * View is a view abstraction that only provides the methods needed by the controller,
 * therefore here the view could refer to any view implementing the interface, without
 * changing the controller class.
